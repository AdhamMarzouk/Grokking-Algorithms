# Grokking Algorithms 
This repository contains my implementations and practice examples based on the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. 
It includes various algorithms and data structures along with some additional practice problems.
Each algorithm implementation is well documented in the code file with comments for easier problem explanation and strudying.

You will not find any implementation for chapter 5 and 9. As chapter 5 was an illustration of hash-maps which are dictionaries in python,
while chapter 9 was explanation of Dynamic Programming without any implementation.
